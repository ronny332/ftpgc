# ftpgc - Gamecube FTP server for Swiss-GC

ftpgc will use [netgc](https://github.com/ronny332/netgc) and [swiss-gc](https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc) to create a small and hopefully fast FTP server, which serves data, when Swiss-GC is running.

as netgc is still is production, here is little to see.

let's start from here and see were we get :blush:.
